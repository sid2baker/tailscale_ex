defmodule Tailscale do
  @moduledoc """
  Supervised Tailscale networking for Elixir and Nerves.

  The daemon owns configuration, identity, authentication, and persistence.
  This library manages its lifecycle, issues commands, and caches observations.
  The OTP application starts automatically; do not add it to your supervision tree.
  Commands wait for the observer's initial snapshot, returning an error if unavailable.
  Cache reads and subscriptions never perform daemon I/O.

  ## Application options

  Set these with `config :tailscale, option: value`. They are read at application
  startup; change running daemon settings with `update_configuration/1` instead.

  | Option | Default | Purpose |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `:manage_daemon` | `true` | Start and supervise a daemon; `false` attaches to an existing one. |
  | `:daemon_path` | `"tailscaled"` | Executable name on PATH or path on the running device. |
  | `:tun` | `:kernel` | `:kernel` uses `tailscale0`; `:userspace` needs no TUN; a string names a TUN interface. |
  | `:data_dir` | See below | Base directory for managed daemon storage. |
  | `:state_dir` | `<data_dir>/identity` | Daemon identity and profile storage. |
  | `:socket` | See below | LocalAPI Unix socket. |
  | `:port` | `0` | Managed daemon UDP port; `0` chooses automatically. |
  | `:config` | `%{}` | Managed defaults for `reset_to_defaults/0`, never applied at startup. |
  | `:timeout` | `5_000` | LocalAPI request and command readiness timeouts, in milliseconds. |
  | `:initial_timeout` | `10_000` | Milliseconds to receive an initial watch snapshot. |
  | `:retry_min`, `:retry_max` | `200`, `30_000` | Backoff bounds in milliseconds for restarts, reconnects, and failed reads. |
  | `:auth_url_ttl` | `600_000` | Maximum cached login URL lifetime in milliseconds. |
  | `:max_body`, `:max_frame` | `4_194_304` each | Byte limits for HTTP response bodies and watch frames. |

  `data_dir` defaults to `/data/tailscale_ex` when Nerves.Runtime is available,
  otherwise `~/.local/share/tailscale_ex`. Use durable writable storage for identity.
  The managed socket defaults to `<data_dir>/run/tailscaled.sock`.

  To attach to an existing daemon:

      config :tailscale,
        manage_daemon: false,
        socket: "/var/run/tailscale/tailscaled.sock"

  This is also the default socket in external mode. The application needs permission
  to use it; commands change that daemon's settings. Launch options such as `:tun`,
  `:daemon_path`, and `:state_dir` do not reconfigure an external daemon.

  Userspace mode supports Serve without root or a TUN device, but creates no
  host-wide interface. Kernel mode requires TUN support and OS permissions;
  kernel subnet routing also needs IP forwarding. Userspace subnet routing has
  protocol limitations. Advertising routes still requires tailnet route approval.
  Tailscale SSH needs tailnet SSH policy, local OS accounts, and permission to start
  their sessions; it is not restricted to kernel mode. See Tailscale's
  [routing modes](https://tailscale.com/kb/1177/kernel-vs-userspace-routers) and
  [SSH setup](https://tailscale.com/kb/1193/tailscale-ssh) for prerequisites.

  Tailscale 1.102.3 is the tested protocol baseline. The observer accepts 1.102.3+
  within 1.x, but later versions still need compatibility testing.

  ## Managed settings

  Both configuration APIs accept an atom-keyed map of these fields only:

  | Field | Library default | Values |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `:hostname` | `""` | DNS label up to 63 characters, normalized to lowercase; empty uses the daemon's default hostname. |
  | `:accept_dns` | `false` | Whether to accept tailnet DNS configuration; opt in with `true`. |
  | `:accept_routes` | `false` | Whether to accept advertised subnet routes. |
  | `:ssh` | `false` | Whether to enable Tailscale SSH. |
  | `:advertise_routes` | `[]` | CIDR strings or `{ip_tuple, prefix_length}`; normalized to sorted, unique network CIDRs. |
  | `:serve` | `[]` | `[%{https: port, to: "http://127.0.0.1:4000"}]`; unique ports in `1..65535`, HTTP(S) targets without userinfo or fragments. |

  DNS management is opt-in: `accept_dns: false` leaves it to the device's network
  stack and avoids `/etc/resolv.conf` write errors on read-only Nerves filesystems.
  This does not disable tailnet connectivity or inbound Serve, but does not configure
  the device to resolve other peers' MagicDNS names.

  `configure/1` replaces all of these fields; `update_configuration/1` preserves
  omitted fields. Startup only reads settings, and login does not apply these defaults.
  `reset_to_defaults/0` explicitly applies `:config` with library defaults for its
  omitted fields. A fresh or existing daemon may still have DNS enabled; use
  `update_configuration(%{accept_dns: false})` to disable it without resetting other
  settings.

  Setting `:serve` replaces all top-level TCP/Web listeners and disables Funnel,
  including settings made outside this library. Separate Tailscale Services are
  preserved; active foreground Serve configurations cause an error. Each endpoint
  proxies `/` over HTTPS on the observed tailnet DNS name. Enable MagicDNS and HTTPS
  in the tailnet first. This does not replace the upstream app's authentication.

  Writes are serialized between library callers and verified by readback, not
  automatically retried. Preferences and Serve are separate operations and may
  partially apply. Concurrent external changes can cause a conflict; inspect
  `get_configuration/0` before deciding whether to retry. Settings made before
  enrollment can be lost on daemon restart.

  ## Properties

  Subscribe **before** reading an initial value. Properties are cached observations,
  not a live connectivity check. Runtime properties are never persisted.

  * `["state"]`: `:unavailable | :offline | :online`. Online means backend Running;
    unavailable means the observer cannot determine connectivity.
  * `["backend_state"]`: `:unknown | :no_state | :in_use_other_user | :needs_login |
    :needs_machine_auth | :stopped | :starting | :running`.
  * `["ipv4"]`, `["ipv6"]`: Erlang IP tuples; absent until assigned.
  * `["hostname"]`, `["dns_name"]`: self host and tailnet DNS names.
  * `["auth", "state"]`: `:unknown | :needs_login | :authenticating |
    :needs_approval | :authenticated | :stopped | :error`.
  * `["auth", "url"]`: secret HTTPS enrollment URL, removed on completion, error,
    disconnect, or cache expiry. `:auth_url_ttl` does not extend the server's URL validity.
  * `["auth", "error"]`: sanitized failure category, absent on success.
  * `["peers", id, field]`: stable node ID (numeric fallback), with `"hostname"`,
    `"dns_name"`, `"ipv4"`, `"ipv6"`, and `"online"` fields. Missing values are absent.
  * `["health"]`: raw daemon health warning strings; these can contain login URLs.
    `info/0` redacts HTTP(S) URLs when displaying them.
  * `["configuration", "value"]`: cached managed configuration, absent when preferences
    are unreadable. The `:serve` field is omitted when Serve cannot be read or represented.
  * `["configuration", "state"]`: `:ready | :applying | :error` (latest operation/read).
  * `["configuration", "error"]`: sanitized failure reason, absent on a successful read.
  * `["monitor", "connected"]`, `["monitor", "generation"]`, `["monitor", "error"]`:
    stream diagnostics. `["version"]` is the daemon version.
  * `["daemon", "state"]`: `:external | :running | :restarting`; process status,
    not tailnet connectivity.

  Disconnects and profile resets clear cached identity and peers. A stopped backend
  can retain assigned addresses; use `["state"]`, not an address, to check online status.
  Treat login URLs and raw health text as sensitive, including subscription messages.
  See the README for installation and a quick start.

  Changing hostname and setting nonempty Serve in the same call is rejected before
