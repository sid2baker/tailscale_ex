# Tailscale for Elixir and Nerves

Supervised Tailscale networking, login, HTTPS Serve, and state subscriptions.
Requires Linux, Elixir 1.19+, and OTP 28+. Tested with Tailscale **1.102.3**.

## 1. Install

Add to `mix.exs`; pin a reviewed revision for production:

```elixir
{:tailscale, github: "sid2baker/tailscale_ex"}
```

For Nerves, download the daemon into your firmware overlay:

```sh
export MIX_TARGET=rpi4 # Change to your firmware target.
mix deps.get
mix tailscale.install rootfs_overlay/usr/sbin/tailscaled
```

```elixir
# config/config.exs
config :nerves, :firmware, rootfs_overlay: "rootfs_overlay"
config :tailscale, daemon_path: "/usr/sbin/tailscaled", tun: :userspace
```

On a Linux host, use `mix deps.get` and `mix tailscale.install ./bin/tailscaled`,
then set `daemon_path` to its absolute runtime path and `tun: :userspace`.
The installer verifies the checksum and detects the target architecture;
see `mix help tailscale.install` for overrides. Use separate overlays per architecture.

The application starts automatically—do not add it to your supervision tree.
Userspace mode supports Serve without root or TUN. For a host-wide network interface,
use `tun: :kernel` with TUN support and OS permissions.

Keep `data_dir` on durable writable storage. Defaults: `/data/tailscale_ex` on Nerves,
`~/.local/share/tailscale_ex` elsewhere. For an existing daemon or other options,
see the [API reference](lib/tailscale.ex).

## 2. Configure and log in

In your application's IEx session:

```elixir
:ok = Tailscale.update_configuration(%{hostname: "my-device", accept_dns: false})
Tailscale.login() # Returns {:ok, url}; open it in a browser. Already online: :ok.
Tailscale.info()
```

The library defaults to `accept_dns: false`, leaving system DNS to the device's
network stack and avoiding `/etc/resolv.conf` write errors on read-only Nerves
filesystems. Set it to `true` to opt into tailnet DNS. The explicit update above
is still needed because startup and login do not apply library defaults.

For unattended login, use `Tailscale.login(auth_key: key)` with a key from your
secret source. Login initiates enrollment; observe `["state"]` for `:online`.
Browser login waits up to 30 seconds for a URL, not browser completion.
Treat keys and login URLs as secrets.

`update_configuration/1` preserves omitted fields; `configure/1` resets them to
library defaults. Startup only reads settings. The daemon owns persistence;
settings made before enrollment may be lost on restart. Commands return errors
without retrying writes, and multi-setting changes can partially apply.

## 3. Serve your app over HTTPS

Enable MagicDNS and HTTPS in your tailnet. After login, check
`Tailscale.get(["dns_name"])` for the expected name, then:

```elixir
:ok = Tailscale.update_configuration(%{
  serve: [%{https: 443, to: "http://127.0.0.1:4000"}]
})
```

Visit `https://<dns_name>/` from an authorized tailnet device. This is not public
Funnel access or a replacement for app authentication. Setting `serve` replaces
all top-level listeners and clears Funnel; `serve: []` removes them.
Rename separately, wait for the new DNS name, then reapply Serve.

## 4. Read state and subscribe

Subscribe before reading; events report changes, not an initial snapshot:

```elixir
:ok = Tailscale.subscribe(["state"])
Tailscale.get(["state"]) # :unavailable | :offline | :online
Tailscale.get(["ipv4"])
Tailscale.get_by_prefix(["peers"])
# Messages: {Tailscale, path, old_value, new_value, timestamps}
```

Reads are cached. Use `Tailscale.info()` for a readable report.
See [API docs](lib/tailscale.ex) for settings, properties, login options, and logout.

## Development

Run `mix deps.get && mix ci`. To include isolated real-daemon tests:

```sh
TAILSCALED_TEST_BINARY=/absolute/path/to/tailscaled mix ci
```

Add `TAILSCALE_TEST_NETWORK=1` to enable control-plane URL and invalid-key tests.
Tests never attach to a host daemon; they do not cover enrolled-tailnet HTTPS or hardware.
